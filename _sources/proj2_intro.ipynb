    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool used in many fields, including finance. Researchers have been trying to use ML to predict stock market behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem (Motivation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, predicting the stock market is difficult because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is hard to collect and prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing and designing the right algorithm is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameters (the settings of ML models) are tricky to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s not always clear which features (inputs) to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock prices are naturally volatile and unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study reviews existing research and also explores new factors that may improve stock prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method (Proposed Solution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers tested several ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using different time windows (how far back in time the training data goes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing training batch size, stopping criteria, and training data ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding financial technical indicators (like moving averages).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization instead of traditional random-grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing the training time window made a big difference, with statistically significant results (p < 0.0001).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using genetic-based hyperparameter optimization improved performance by about 40% compared to random-grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding technical indicators did not improve prediction accuracy much, but it slightly improved the ability to predict the direction (up or down) of stock movements for some stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time window and the characteristics of the stock (such as which stock, and which period of time is studied) greatly affected the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The study shows that the way data is prepared, especially the time window chosen, has a major impact on stock market prediction. While some methods, like genetic optimization, significantly improve accuracy, others (like technical indicators) have only limited benefits. Predicting stock prices remains challenging because results vary a lot depending on the stock and time period."
