    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool used in many fields, including finance. Researchers have been trying to use ML to predict stock market behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem (Motivation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, predicting the stock market is difficult because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is hard to collect and prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing and designing the right algorithm is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameters (the settings of ML models) are tricky to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s not always clear which features (inputs) to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock prices are naturally volatile and unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study reviews existing research and also explores new factors that may improve stock prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method (Proposed Solution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers tested several ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using different time windows (how far back in time the training data goes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing training batch size, stopping criteria, and training data ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding financial technical indicators (like moving averages).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization instead of traditional random-grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing the training time window made a big difference, with statistically significant results (p < 0.0001).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using genetic-based hyperparameter optimization improved performance by about 40% compared to random-grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding technical indicators did not improve prediction accuracy much, but it slightly improved the ability to predict the direction (up or down) of stock movements for some stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time window and the characteristics of the stock (such as which stock, and which period of time is studied) greatly affected the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The study shows that the way data is prepared, especially the time window chosen, has a major impact on stock market prediction. While some methods, like genetic optimization, significantly improve accuracy, others (like technical indicators) have only limited benefits. Predicting stock prices remains challenging because results vary a lot depending on the stock and time period."

    "- Background on Predictive Analytics\n",
    "    - Business analytics has three main categories:\n",
    "        - Descriptive techniques – Describe what has happened in the past. Example: looking at last year’s sales numbers.\n",
    "        - Prescriptive techniques – Suggest actions to take. Example: recommending the best way to invest money.\n",
    "        - Predictive techniques – Use data and math to guess what will happen in the future. Example: predicting tomorrow’s stock price.\n",
    "    - Predictive analytics works by using mathematical algorithms and computer programs to find patterns in data.\n",
    "    - Prescriptive analytics goes beyond just showing what happened (descriptive) or predicting what might happen (predictive). It focuses on what you should do to reach the best outcome.\n",
    "    - How prescriptive analytics works: It uses data, models, and algorithms to recommend actions or strategies. Often it relies on tools like optimization, simulations, or decision analysis.\n",
    "    - Goal of prescriptive analytics: To guide decision-making and suggest the “best” choice among many options\n",
    "    - In short: Prescriptive analytics = “Here’s what you should do next.\n",
    "    - Example in Business\n",
    "        - A delivery company wants to reduce fuel costs.\n",
    "            - Descriptive: Shows how much they spent on fuel last year.\n",
    "            - Predictive: Estimates how much fuel they will need next year.\n",
    "            - Prescriptive: Recommends the best delivery routes and schedules to cut costs while still being\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Series Data and Stocks\n",
    "    - Univariate time series data means numbers recorded over time, like daily stock prices.\n",
    "    - Stock market data is a time series because prices are reported at regular time intervals.\n",
    "    - This makes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) very useful, because they are designed to handle sequential (time-based) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods Used in This Study\n",
    "    - This research focuses on finding patterns in financial data and predicting future stock behavior using:\n",
    "    - ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) → Machine learning models that learn from data.\n",
    "    - Genetic Algorithm → An optimization method inspired by natural selection.\n",
