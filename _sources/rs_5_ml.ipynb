    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern mining is an essential approach for identifying significant trends in historical stock data. Candlestick analysis, a widely-used technique, encodes daily stock price movements—open, high, low, and close—into a visual representation. Using identified patterns, subsequence- and similarity-based models can be developed to predict future stock prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to compare the performance of subsequence- and similarity-based models with machine learning algorithms, including tree-based methods, support vector machines, and neural networks, to evaluate their effectiveness in stock price prediction.n.\r\n",
